# HomekitAccessorySpy

HomekitAccessorySpy is a very simple 'Home' app clone.

By touching '+' in the main screen, you can browse for unpaired homekit accessories in your network.
By selecting such an unpaired accessory in the browser and after entering the setup code, a secure HAP session is created with the accessory.
After HomekitAccessorySpy has created the secure HAP session, you can browse the accessory information, request characteristics or put characteristics.
